    <p>The author of the current app ("Pocket Vault") respects your privacy and recognizes your right to be the sole authority over your data.<p>

    <h2 class="header">The information you provide, and how we use this information</h2>
    <p>Pocket Vault doesn't access, use, transmit or otherwise handle any personal information except what is entered by you voluntarily, for the purpose of storing it.</p>
    <p>The information voluntarily provided by you never leaves your device in unencrypted format, unless you explicitly choose to by selecting no encryption.<p>
    <p>This means that as long as you use any of the encryption methods provided by the app, neither humans nor computers will be able to read, analyze or otherwise use the data you collect and store by the means of Pocket Vault. In other words, your data is not used or processed by anyone, and it can't even be used either by the creator or any third party.</p>
    <p>The only piece of data stored in readable form is your Google user ID, a character string which identifies your Google user account (ie.: "i2RrjpkldpV1Mf5jAWKvBNNYf6R2"). This is required for the proper operation of the application.</p>

<div>
    <h2 class="header">Data storage</h2>
    <p>Pocket Vault will not store any personal or other sensitive data on your device or anywhere else in unencrypted format without your knowledge.</p>
    <p>All data entered into the application is stored remotely in Google Firebase, a service provided by Google Inc. Please read Google's privacy statement regarding Firestore here: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2 class="header">Warranty</h2>
    <p>Pocket Vault is provided as-is. Although careful measures have been taken to ensure reliable operation, Pocket Vault is technically a user interface for a third party cloud service, therefore the author can't and won't accept any responsibility in case of data loss or theft.</p>
