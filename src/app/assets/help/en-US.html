    <h2 class="header">What is Pocket Vault?</h2>
    <p>Pocket Vault is a simple and straightforward little app to safely store all the tiny bits of data you're supposed to remember but you just can't.</p>
    <p>Some examples: Your car's VIN and insurance policy number. Your flight club membership number. Customer ID numbers. PIN codes. A locker's combination. Your secret lover's phone number. Or just any username and password.</p>
    <p>Pocket Vault stores all these pieces of information safely in Google's cloud storage, with military level encryption so only you (and not even Google) can access them.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>How secure is Pocket Vault?</h2>
    <p>Pocket Vault offers a set of various encryption methods or ciphers. Some of them are approved for government use, which means they're safe enough for top secret military or intelligence documents. The two most powerful ciphers are AES and Rabbit. You can choose others, and even turn off encryption if you wish so.</p>
    <p>Does that make Pocket Vault unbreakable? No, because there's no unbreakable cipher. Yet the chance for someone to access your data is astronomically low.</p>
    <p>Currently there's no computer technology that can crack AES or Rabbit within reasonable time. It would take thousands of years even for the world's most powerful supercomputers. Yes, it's really that safe. A quantum computer may be able to do it, but there are only a handful of them in the world, and their operators have better things to do than sniffing after you.</p>

    <h2>How is my data stored?</h2>
    <p>You can open <b>collections</b> to organize your data and create <b>items</b> in them to store it. For example you can create a collection named <b>Bank information</b> and store your credit card's number, expiry date, CVV code and PIN code as individual items. You can create further collections within other collections, similarly to folders on your computer.</p>
    <p>To view a stored item, open the collection that holds it and swipe left on the item to reveal its value. Ensure that nobody looks over your shoulder!</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Where is my data stored?</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored in Google's cloud. Nothing is stored on your device. Therefore even if your device is lost or stolen, your data will still be safe.</p>
    <p>Even if your Google account is compromised, the attacker will not be able to access your data without the Master Password.</p>
    <p>Your data is safe even from Google or the government (any government). They may obtain the data file, but only you can unlock it.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>What is the Master Password?</h2>
    <p>The Master Password is the only password you'll have to remember. It's the key to your encrypted data.</p>
    <p>When you launch the app for the first time, Pocket Vault will ask you to choose a Master Password. Choose a safe password you can easily remember. Here are a few recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Never choose something obvious like your child's name or "password" or "abc123"!</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Never disclose the Master Password to anyone!</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Use a "safe" password that's at least 10-12 characters long and contains letters, numbers and at least one special character.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;Be aware though that if you forget your Master Password, there'll be <b>NO WAY</b> to recover your data! A long, random string of characters may be very secure, but will you be able to remember it?</li>
        <li>&nbsp;If you think you have to write down the Master Password, store it in a safe place.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is a common method to generate a safe password.<p>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Pick a phrase you can easily remember. For example: <b>Yogi Bear</b></li>
        <li>&nbsp;Now replace every letter you can to a number that resembles that letter: <b>Y0G1 B34R</b></li>
        <li>&nbsp;Add a special character somewhere. You can replace a space with an underscore: <b>Y0G1_B34R</b></li>
    </ul>  
    <p>Now you have a safe password. It can be much longer and you can decorate it even further. For example: <b>Y0Gi_b34R_L0V35_F00D!</b><p>
    <p>Be aware that although it would be easier to break into Fort Knox than Pocket Vault (and that's not an exaggeration), an attacker may obtain your Master Password by other means. For example your keypresses may be secretly recorded by a keylogger. If you aren't an everyday person, and have powerful enemies, consider hiring a data security expert to eliminate such dangers.</p>

<div>
    <h2>Can I change the Master Password?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can change the Master Password and the cipher from the <b>Settings</b> menu.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Can I save my data locally?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can export your vault into text or JSON format. Don't think of this as a backup option though! The file is entirely unencrypted, and anyone accessing your device can obtain your data. It is your responsibility to keep it safe outside of the Vault. Think of it as taking out something valuable from an actual vault.</p>
    <p>After exporting, these files must be moved to a safe location, which is your responsibility. The <b>Settings</b> menu offers the option <b>Delete all exports</b> which will safely remove all exported files from the <b>Downloads</b> directory, as long as their filename is unchanged. This is no ordinary deletion: before the file is erased, it's overwritten with garbage data, so if anyone manages to get hold of your device and restore the deleted file, its contents will still be unaccessible.</p>

    <h2>How can I be sure that Pocket Vault is really what it claims to be, and not some clever spyware?</h2>
    <p>Pocket Vault is open source. If you know how to code, you can analyze it, or even build your own modified version.</p>
