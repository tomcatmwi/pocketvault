# Pocket Vault
A simple serverless NativeScript application to store encrypted personal data in Google Firebase. Also a good practical showcase of some basic Angular/NativeScript techniques.

# Note
To clone and run it you have to create your own Google Firebase project and replace `google-services.json`.

Someday I may write a proper readme.
